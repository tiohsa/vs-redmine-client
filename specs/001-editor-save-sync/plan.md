# Implementation Plan: Editor Save Sync to Redmine

**Branch**: `001-editor-save-sync` | **Date**: 2025-12-26 | **Spec**: /home/glorydays/projects/src/ts/todoex/specs/001-editor-save-sync/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-editor-save-sync/spec.md`

**Note**: This plan is generated by `/speckit.plan`.

## Summary

Update the editor save flow so changes are sent to Redmine on save, with conflict detection, unreachable handling, and concise success/error feedback. The plan uses the existing VS Code extension stack and focuses on sending only changed fields, blocking on conflicts, and preserving local edits on failure.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.9
**Primary Dependencies**: VS Code Extension API, webpack, @vscode/test-cli
**Storage**: In-memory ticket draft state (no persistent storage changes)
**Testing**: VS Code extension tests via @vscode/test-cli
**Target Platform**: VS Code desktop extension
**Project Type**: single
**Performance Goals**: 95% of save actions with changes complete within 10 seconds
**Constraints**: No silent data loss; block on conflicts; avoid sending updates when no changes
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user interactive editing per ticket; typical save frequency during editing

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- TDD: unit tests written first and confirmed Red before implementation.
- TypeScript strict mode remains enabled; type checks pass.
- DRY: no duplicated business logic without justification.

**Structure Decision**: Single project with `src/` and `tests/` per repository layout.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

None.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Research Tasks

1. Confirm recommended conflict handling for Redmine ticket updates when remote changes exist.
2. Confirm best practice for partial-field updates to avoid overwriting unchanged data.
3. Confirm user feedback expectations for save success/failure within a VS Code extension UX.

### Findings (to be captured in research.md)

- Decisions on conflict handling, partial-field updates, and feedback patterns, with rationale and alternatives.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Data Model

Create `data-model.md` describing Ticket Draft, Redmine Ticket, and Sync Result entities with fields and relationships.

### Contracts

Create OpenAPI contract(s) in `contracts/` for Redmine ticket refresh and update operations used by the save flow.

### Quickstart

Create `quickstart.md` with local setup and test commands for this feature.

### Agent Context

Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh codex` after design artifacts are generated.

## Phase 2: Task Planning

Stop after Phase 2 planning as per workflow.
