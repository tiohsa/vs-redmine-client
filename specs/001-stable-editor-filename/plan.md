# Implementation Plan: Stable Editor Filenames with Comment Numbers

**Branch**: `001-stable-editor-filename` | **Date**: 2025-12-26 | **Spec**: /home/glorydays/projects/src/ts/todoex/specs/001-stable-editor-filename/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-stable-editor-filename/spec.md`

**Note**: This plan is generated by `/speckit.plan`.

## Summary

Provide stable, unique filenames for ticket and comment editor saves based on project/ticket/comment identifiers, and display comment numbers in the comment list. This prevents filename churn on every edit and improves comment identification.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.9
**Primary Dependencies**: VS Code Extension API, webpack, @vscode/test-cli
**Storage**: N/A (filenames computed from identifiers; no new persistence)
**Testing**: VS Code extension tests via @vscode/test-cli
**Target Platform**: VS Code desktop extension
**Project Type**: single
**Performance Goals**: Filenames generated instantly on save; comment list renders without visible delay
**Constraints**: Filenames must remain stable across edits and unique per ticket/comment
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user editing sessions; comment lists per ticket

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- TDD: unit tests written first and confirmed Red before implementation.
- TypeScript strict mode remains enabled; type checks pass.
- DRY: no duplicated business logic without justification.

### Source Code (repository root)

**Structure Decision**: Single project with `src/` and `tests/` per repository layout.

## Complexity Tracking

None.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Research Tasks

1. Confirm best practices for stable file naming for VS Code untitled/save flows.
2. Confirm conventions for representing comment numbers in lists.

### Findings (to be captured in research.md)

- Decisions on filename schema and comment list formatting, with rationale and alternatives.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Data Model

Create `data-model.md` describing filename components and comment list items.

### Contracts

No external API contracts required.

### Quickstart

Create `quickstart.md` with local setup and test commands for this feature.

### Agent Context

Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh codex` after design artifacts are generated.

## Phase 2: Task Planning

Stop after Phase 2 planning as per workflow.
